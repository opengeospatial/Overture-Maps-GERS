== GERS Framework Requirements Clasess

This Clause defines requirements classes with a standardization target of an implementation of the GERS Model. Specifically, requirements defined in this clause are focused on the elements of the model required to implement the GERS model. This clause does not define requirements for conflation, work flows, or storage/processing technologies.

=== Requirement Class Coordinate Reference System

The CRS Requirements Class states that all coordinates used in any geometry, query, tiling scheme, and so on in an implementation of the GERS model must be in the same (consistent) coordinate reference system.

NOTE: This requirements class is based on and is consistent with the CDB 2.0 CRS Requirements Class.

Use the following table for Requirements Classes.

include::../requirements/requirements_class-gers-crs.adoc[]

==== Requirement 1: CRS definition

The following requirement states that any metadata used in a GERS implementation be consistent with OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Referencing by coordinates (ISO 19111:2019).

include::../requirements/REQ01-crs-topic2.adoc[]

==== Requirement 2: Use same CRS Throughout

The following requirement states that any implementatin of the GERS Framework compliant with this standard specifies only one CRS. This requirement ensures that rigorous coordinate transformations as stated in OGC Topic 2 can be successfully performed without loss of data.

include::../requirements/REQ02-crs-storage.adoc[]

=== Requirement 3: Valid CRS

The following requirement states that only no-projected coordinate reference systems are used in an implementaiton of the GERS framework. The are several reasons for this requirement, one of which is the possible use of global tiled storage systems for the reference map.

include::../requirements/REQ03-crs-valid.adoc[]

Dictionary tables for requirements can be added as necessary. Modify the following example as needed.
