name:: Definition of a bounding box
identifier:: req/gers-general-bbox
part:: The bounding box _SHALL_ be in the Coordinate Reference System used for a given implementation of the GERS framework.
part:: The bounding box is a rectalinear area that _SHALL_ be defined by values for xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax. latitude is a decimal number between -90.0 and 90.0; longitude is a decimal number between -180.0 and 180.0. 
guidance: This bbox definition is different from most others as used, for example, in GeoJSON which is min_longitude, min_latitude, max_longitude, max_latitude. 
====


GeoJSON: The value of the bbox member MUST be an array of
   length 2*n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the
   contained geometries, with all axes of the most southwesterly point
   followed by all axes of the more northeasterly point.  The axes order
   of a bbox follows the axes order of geometries.
