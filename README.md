# Overture Maps/OGC Global Entity Reference System (GERS)

## OGC: GERS Community Standard

### What is GERS

The Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is a framework created by the http://https://overturemaps.org/[Overture Maps Foundation] to provide unique, persistent identifiers (GERS IDs) for real-world entities such as buildings, places, and roads in their open map data. These IDs facilitate data interoperability and sharing by enabling different datasets to be easily connected and enriched using a common reference.

### Who supports GERS?

GERS is supported by a diverse community of over 40 organizations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Meta, Microsoft, TomTom, and Esri. These companies have committed to and depend on Overture data. Overture powers the maps used by billions of people across Meta’s, Microsoft’s, TomTom’s, and Esri’s platforms. Many of the Overture Maps supporting organizations are also OGC Member organization.
