== Global Entity Reference System Concepts

This clause provides information on the concepts essential to the GERS model or framework. The discussion begins with a model of the GERS framework.

=== The GERS Model - High Level

The following is a high level view of the GERS framework.

Each of the key components is now described.

==== GERS Unique Identifier

GERS IDs are generated and formatted based on the IETF RFC https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122[A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace]. In an implementation of the GERS framework, every GERS ID follows the standard UUID format (e.g., 12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678), making them:

* Globally unique
* System-agnostic
* Easy to implement in any database or application
* Compatible with existing UUID tools and libraries

Why it matters:

* Universal compatibility: UUIDs work in every modern database and programming language
* No collisions: Guaranteed uniqueness across all systems
* Standard tooling: Leverage existing UUID libraries and utilities

==== GERS Registry

A GERS registry is a comprehensive database documenting every GERS ID created in a given GERS implementation.

Think of the GERS Registry as the authoritative phonebook for GERS IDs. It maintains:

* Complete lifecycle information for every ID
* Current location data for active entities
* Historical records for deprecated IDs
* Quick lookup capabilities for ID verification

Why it matters:

* Validation: Instantly verify if a UUID is a legitimate GERS ID
* History: Access the complete lifecycle of any GERS ID
* Efficiency: Quickly “catch up” if you haven’t updated for several releases
* Location services: Find where entities exist both geographically and within file structures

==== GERS Bridge Files

==== GERS Reference Map

A GERS reference map contains feature data that connect GERS IDs to real-world entities. 

Data contained in the reference map should be carefully validated, consistently structured collections that describe potentially billions of real-world entities. 

Each entity in the reference map datasets carries a unique GERS ID. These IDs represent actual physical entities in the world, from the corner coffee shop to the roads in a navigation route.

Why it matters:

* Open and free: GERS IDs reference elements in a global, open, free, and accessible. There is no risk of lock-in because any ID system can also match with GERS.
