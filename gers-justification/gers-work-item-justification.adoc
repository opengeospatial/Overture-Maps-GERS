== Introduction

This document provides a justification as why the OGC Technical Committee (TC) should consider the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) framework as an OGC Community Standard. This justification, along with the submitted candidate Community Standard, will form the basis for TC review and vote to approve the start of a Work Item as the first step in the Community Standard process for this standard.

The submitters agree to abide by the TC Policies and Procedures and OGC http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/policies[Intellectual Property Rights Policy] during the processing of this submission.

Once approved, the GERS Community Standard Work Item defined by this document is valid for a period of six (6) months from the approval date.

More information on the Overture Maps GERS framework can be found https://overturemaps.org/blog/2025/understanding-overtures-global-entity-reference-system/[here].

== Overview of proposed submission

This section provides an overview of the proposed submission, benefits of implementing GERS and a summary of the GERS Model.

The Global Entity Reference System (GERS) was developed by the https://overturemaps.org/[Overture Maps Foundation]. The latest version launched in June 2025 as a way to provide unique, open, and interoperable identifiers for geospatial entities such as buildings, places, and road segments. This system aims to simplify data integration and sharing across different datasets and platforms, fostering collaboration and innovation in the geospatial industry.

Overture provides a complete and operational implementation of the GERS Model that includes data schemas, a registry schema, the GERS ID generation, processes, tools, and the physical foundation reference map maintained by the Overture Map Foundation. 

The proposed OGC GERS Community Standard will have a more limited focus the logical model for a GERS framework as documented in the current Overture data, bridge, change log, reference map, and registry schemas. This focus defines a standard that can be implemented by any organization that will be 100% consistent with the existing Overture Maps Foundation reference map and IDs but "owned" by the implementing organization.

=== Overview of the GERS Model and Reference System

Organizations can spend an enormous mount of time and resources on data preparation and integration rather than value-adding analysis. For organizations using geospatial data, the challenge is even more acute: Different data producers describe the same real-world entities in different ways, use different reference systems, and different ontologies. The combinations of these differences make it expensive and time-consuming to combine datasets from these different sources. 

Often, the cost of integrating data exceeds the cost of the initial data capture and any related licensing. This is the data conflation tax – a hidden cost that affects everyone working with data obtained from multiple sources.

GERS changes this equation by providing persistent, unique identifiers for every geospatial entity – from buildings and roads to places and addresses. With GERS, what once took weeks of complex geospatial conflation can now be accomplished in minutes with simple column joins.

=== What will be standardized?

The following components of the Global Entity Reference System will be addressed in the GERS Community Standard. The source of the content for the draft Community Standard is the July 2025 of the Overture GERS release.

- BridgeFiles: Bridge files connect the unique GERS IDs to the entity identifiers used in the source data. These files are a key component of GERS and offer two critical capabilities: reverse lookup of source features and the ability to join content from multipoe geospatial data repositories.
- ChangeLog: A GERS changelog capture changes in the map data from the previous release to the current release. This information can be used to guide decisions about data matching, better understand data stability, and help detect data errors.
- GERS ID: The requirements for generating a unique GERS ID. A GERS ID is a unique identifier for real-world geospatial entities across data releases and maintains consistency when the same entity appears in multiple source datasets. 
- ReferenceMap: A reference map of all entities that have been assigned a unique GERS ID. The content in the reference map is defined by a set of JSON schema.
- Registry: A GERS Registry serves as the single source of truth for all entities that are part of an implementation of a Global Entity Reference System.
- JSON Schema: The format of the content stored in the reference map is defined using JSON schema. Overture releases their reference map data as GeoParquet. GeoJSON is used as the default canonical geospatial format. GeoJSON provides a "mental model and language" to express data constructions in the schema. The OGC GERS Community Standard schema reference docs will describe key schema concepts for each theme and definitions and examples for each feature type.
- Feature Types: The source Overture JSON schema provide type enumerations for the base themes, such as land cover types. The OGC GERS Community Standard will define how an enumeration contained in the schema can be extended while maintaining backwards compatibility.

Each of the above components are defined using JSON Schema that will clearly and fully documented in the OGC GERS Community Standard. 

=== What will not be in the Community Standard

No Overture maintained data, registry content, maps, tools, or workflow processes will be part of the OGC Community Standard.

=== Benefits of implementing a GERS Framework

The key benefits of implementing a GERS framework as identified by the Overture Foundation community are as follow.

- Simplified Data Integration: GERS IDs allow developers to easily link datasets by joining columns rather than relying on complex data conflation processes, saving time and resources. 
- Reduced Costs: By streamlining data integration, GERS helps reduce the "hidden tax" of data integration, making it more cost-effective to incorporate new data into mapping solutions. 
- Increased Interoperability: GERS promotes interoperability by providing a common language for identifying geospatial entities, enabling data sharing and collaboration between different organizations and platforms. 
- Enhanced Data Richness: With GERS, it becomes easier to enrich map data with information from various sources, leading to more comprehensive and informative mapping applications. 
- Innovation in Geospatial: GERS is expected to drive innovation in the geospatial industry by reducing barriers to data integration and enabling the development of new and more powerful mapping solutions. 

=== GERS Value Proposition - Summary

Key value points include the following.

- Data integration: Simplifies the exchange and integration of map data by using a universal system of consistent identifiers (GERS IDs) for entities.
- Reliability: Provides persistent IDs and changelogs for geospatial entities, improving data traceability, auditability, and accuracy.
- Accessibility: As a free and open backbone, GERS provides a no-cost path to global identifiers and prevents vendor lock-in.
- AI and data pipelines: Offers persistent identifiers that help ground facts to real-world assets, which is crucial for training and operating accurate AI system. 

== Motivation of supporting OGC Members for this submission

////
Provide a brief paragraph from one or more supporting OGC members that describes why they are supporting this submission and how they feel it helps the geospatial community.
////

=== Overture Maps Foundation
The Overture Maps Foundation submits and supports GERS as an OGC Community Standard to ensure long-term, open, and vendor-neutral stewardship of the framework. Overture’s goal in advancing GERS through OGC is to encourage broad, global adoption of a consistent reference system that benefits commercial, government, research, and open-source communities.

OGC governance provides a durable home for the logical GERS framework, separate from any single implementation, and allows organizations worldwide to implement compatible GERS-based systems aligned with open standards, shared schemas, and transparent change processes. The Foundation affirms that elevating GERS into the OGC Standards Program is essential to establishing a common, interoperable identifier fabric for the world’s geospatial data.

=== Esri
Esri supports the submission of the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) as an OGC Community Standard because globally unique, open identifiers are foundational to interoperable GIS workflows. Persistent identifiers enable scalable joins, efficient data enrichment, and reliable cross-dataset interoperability - capabilities that are increasingly critical as organizations integrate larger and more diverse datasets.

Esri has already integrated GERS identifiers into key workflows to demonstrate the practical value of an open entity reference system, including using GERS IDs to join the Overture Buildings dataset with FEMA’s USA Structures dataset. By using GERS IDs as join keys, Esri achieved high match rates (≈ 98 %) and enabled enriched visualization and analytic workflows in ArcGIS, including enhanced 3D scene layers and thematic mapping. This example highlights how GERS can significantly reduce reliance on complex geoprocessing and spatial conflation, improving efficiency and accuracy in real-world GIS operations. 

By developing the GERS Community Standard through OGC, Esri believes the framework will gain wider adoption across the geospatial ecosystem, strengthening interoperability and reducing barriers to data integration across public, private, and research domains. Standardization in OGC also helps ensure that implementations of GERS remain aligned with complementary OGC API standards and other elements of the international geospatial standards baseline.




=== Sparkgeo
As a geospatial consultancy, Sparkgeo works extensively with diverse datasets across multiple domains, including climate, infrastructure, mobility, and remote sensing. A recurring challenge is the lack of a consistent, open, and persistent identifier for real-world geospatial entities. This gap creates unnecessary complexity in data integration, slows the development of interoperable solutions, and increases the cost of building reliable location-based products. These issues incur a cost associated with using geospatial data. The so-called conflation tax.

GERS addresses this need by establishing a globally unique, stable, and open identifier system for geospatial entities. GERS provides a reference fabric that significantly reduces the burden of feature conflation and supports enrichment across datasets and providers. This aligns closely with Sparkgeo’s commitment to open standards, reproducible workflows, and scalable cloud-native geospatial practices.

We believe that advancing GERS through the OGC standards process is the right path. The governance, transparency, and technical rigour provided by OGC are essential for broad adoption and long-term stewardship. Elevating GERS to an OGC Community Standard will strengthen the geospatial ecosystem as a whole and provide a foundation that benefits both data producers and consumers.

Sparkgeo supports the inclusion of GERS as an OGC community standard. We look forward to the continued impact GERS will have on the interoperability and reliability of global geospatial data.

=== Precisely
Precisely supports this submission because the Global Entity Reference System provides a practical and scalable framework for integrating heterogeneous datasets, which is an essential requirement for organizations working with high-volume, multi-source geospatial information. The linkage between GERS identifiers and Precisely’s own persistent identifiers has demonstrated measurable reductions in integration effort and greater accuracy in data matching.

By establishing GERS as an OGC Community Standard, Precisely expects wider industry alignment on a trusted global identifier system, lowering barriers to data interoperability and supporting consistent enrichment of location-based datasets. A standardized GERS framework will enhance the reliability and utility of geospatial data products across multiple domains, from property intelligence to market analytics.


== Alignment with OGC and other International Standards

=== Alignment with Non OGC International Standards

The GERS model and framework is based on the following international standards from the IETF, ISO, and the OGC including:

- The GERS ID is generated following the rules as defined in IETF https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122[RFC 4122] A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace.
- The GERS geometry model is consistent with https://www.iso.org/standard/26012.html[ISO 19107] as instantiated by the recommended use of GeoJSON as the encoding format for geometry in the GERS reference map data store.
- https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema] is used for defining all GERS schema including the ID registry and the structure of the foundation maps in the GERS reference map data store.
- https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet[GeoParquet] is the recommended distribution format for geospatial content contained in the reference map data store.

NOTE: A GERS reference map is a set of validated datasets that connect GERS IDs to real-world entities. The Overture GERS implementation provides a reference map with monthly open map data updates. These data updates are carefully validated, consistently structured collections that describe billions of real-world entities. Each entity in these datasets carries a unique GERS ID. These IDs represent actual physical entities in the world.

NOTE: Overture Maps Foundation provides global data across six data themes (addresses, base, buildings, divisions, places, and transportation), using well-partitioned GeoParquet as their primary distribution format across multiple clouds. This reference map consists of billions of features across hundreds of gigabytes. 

===  Alignment with OGC Standards baseline

==== Relationship to OGC Points of Interest (PoI) Conceptual Model Standard

The OGC docs.ogc.org/is/21-049/21-049.html[Points of Interest] (POI) Conceptual Model is an open data model for representing information about POI. 
A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates and an identifier. The model specifically states that "An encoding of the AbstractFeature class SHALL include zero or one identifier attributes" (Requirement 6) and that if an identifier is specified that the identifier of the feature is unique and valid globally.

NOTE: From PoI Standard - Abstract Feature class in POI model: identifier «property»	ScopedName [0..*]	Specifies the unique identifier of the feature that is valid globally.

Further, the geometry model specified in the GERS Model is consistent with the PoI geometry model (/req/core/geometry):

-The POI Conceptual Model spatial geometry properties SHALL be compliant with the Geometry Model defined in ISO 19107
- The spatial geometry properties of all POI instances SHALL be defined using one or more of the following classes: GM_Point, GM_LineString, GM_Polygon.

==== Relationship to OGC CDB 2.0 Standard

The CDB User Community has, for years, asked for better indexing and discovery capabilities as part of a CDB structured datastore. Implementing components for the GERS Framework, such as a Registry, Change Log, and Bridge files. Further, having a unique ID for every entity in a CDB datastore would 1.) support cross LoD feature joins, 2.) enable easier and searchable change history (versioning), and 3.) enable joins with non-CDB geospatial repositories - such as the Overture Maps GERS members map contributions.

==== Relationship to OGC API Standards

An OGC API Records endpoint could being uses to access and maintain a GERS Registry instance.

An OGC API Features endpoint could being uses to search, access and maintain a GERS reference map. GeoJSON is the default GERS format for exchange of geospatial content.

=== Relationship to existing OGC standards baseline and standards summary

The proposed GERS Community Standard does not conflict with or overlap functionality defined in the current OGC Standards baseline or new standards being developed.

The GERS Model and implementations build on the existing OGC/ISO Standards baseline. Further, implementations of various OGC API Standards could be used to access a GERS reference map data store.

=== *Regrid: Integration of GERS with U.S. Parcel Data:*

*Date of most recent version:*

Fall 2025

*Implementation description:*

Regrid has implemented the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) to establish persistent, identifier-based linkages between its nationwide parcel dataset and external geospatial data describing real-world entities such as points of interest, addresses, and property features. Regrid’s database includes over 155 million property boundaries across the United States, each with a unique Regrid ID. By associating these parcel records with GERS identifiers, Regrid provides a standardized bridge between local property information and globally referenced entities.

Regrid maintains and distributes a crosswalk file linking millions of parcel records to corresponding GERS IDs representing nearby or associated real-world features—such as commercial establishments, institutions, or civic facilities. This linkage allows data users to integrate parcel-level information with other datasets containing location-based attributes, such as business characteristics, land use, or infrastructure details. The GERS-based connection supports deterministic joins between data from different providers, eliminating dependence on approximate spatial or textual matching methods.

This implementation demonstrates a large-scale, production application of GERS within a national parcel data system. By embedding GERS IDs directly in its APIs and downloadable datasets, Regrid operationalizes the identifier as an interoperability mechanism, enabling consistent data integration across public, commercial, and open geospatial sources.

=== *CARTO: Use of GERS for Scalable Data Integration in Cloud Environments:*

*Date of most recent version:*

Summer 2025

*Implementation description:*

CARTO has implemented the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) within its spatial analytics and data integration platform to support standardized, identifier-based joins across distributed geospatial datasets. The company demonstrated this capability through examples running on cloud data warehouses such as Databricks, where GERS IDs were used to align spatial tables representing buildings, address locations, and activity points sourced from multiple providers.

In these workflows, GERS identifiers serve as persistent join keys for linking heterogeneous data sources directly in SQL, removing the need for computationally intensive spatial joins or manual conflation. CARTO’s integration shows that GERS can operate effectively as a stable reference key within scalable, columnar databases and analytical engines that process millions of location records.

This implementation provides concrete operational evidence that GERS functions as a reliable interoperability mechanism in production-grade, cloud-based data environments. It demonstrates that GERS can underpin efficient, repeatable integration workflows across diverse geospatial data providers without dependency on geometry or coordinate matching.

=== *Joint Research Centre (JRC): Evaluation of GERS for Cross-Boundary Data Harmonization:*

*Date of most recent version:*

Fall 2025

*Implementation description:*

The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) has evaluated the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) as part of research on improving interoperability among European spatial datasets. In a 2025 Data in Brief publication, JRC scientists documented the use of GERS identifiers to match administrative units, address points, and built environment features from multiple open and institutional sources across European countries.

The study compared GERS-based entity linking against traditional spatial overlay and text-based matching, finding that GERS reduced ambiguity and improved reproducibility of cross-dataset joins. The experiment demonstrated that GERS can act as a stable reference key for integrating heterogeneous datasets conforming to INSPIRE data models and the European Data Strategy framework.

This peer-reviewed analysis provides independent, quantitative evidence of GERS performance in a multi-jurisdictional context. It confirms that GERS can facilitate data harmonization across administrative boundaries—an essential requirement for European spatial data infrastructures and other federated data ecosystems.

=== *Fused: Use of GERS IDs in Data Enrichment and Tile Services:*

*Date of most recent version:*

Summer 2025

*Implementation description:*

Fused has implemented the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) across its hosted map-tiling and enrichment APIs to maintain consistent, globally unique identifiers for geographic features such as buildings, roads, and places. GERS identifiers are preserved through Fused’s vector tile pipelines, enabling users to request and enrich map features by their persistent IDs across data updates and service layers.

Fused demonstrates this integration through public technical documentation showing API-based enrichment using GERS IDs as keys to attach user-defined attributes—such as business metadata, analytics outputs, or risk assessments—to base geographic entities. These examples confirm that GERS can operate as a durable feature identifier within real-time, developer-facing geospatial infrastructure.

By exposing GERS IDs through its APIs and map tiles, Fused provides a functioning model for how GERS can support interoperability and data consistency across distributed geospatial systems. This implementation demonstrates that GERS performs effectively in automated, high-frequency data pipelines where feature persistence and identifier stability are critical.
