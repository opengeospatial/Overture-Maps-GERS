To: OGC members & interested parties

A new OGC Standards Working Group is being formed. The OGC members listed below have proposed the OGC <Name of SWG>.  The SWG proposal provided in this document meets the requirements of the OGC Technical Committee (TC) Policies and Procedures.

The SWG name, statement of purpose, scope, list of deliverables, audience, and language specified in the proposal will constitute the SWG's official charter. Technical discussions may occur no sooner than the SWG's first meeting.

This SWG will operate under the OGC IPR Policy. The eligibility requirements for becoming a participant in the SWG at the first meeting (see details below) are that:

* You must be an employee of an OGC member organization or an individual
member of OGC;

* The OGC member must have signed the OGC Membership agreement;

* You must notify the SWG chair of your intent to participate to the first meeting. Members may do so by logging onto the OGC Portal and navigating to the Observer page and clicking on the link for the SWG they wish to join and;

* You must attend meetings of the SWG. The first meeting of this SWG is at the time and date fixed below. Attendance may be by teleconference.

Of course, participants also may join the SWG at any time. The OGC and the SWG welcomes all interested parties.

Non-OGC members who wish to participate may contact us about joining the OGC. In addition, the public may access some of the resources maintained for each SWG: the SWG public description, the SWG Charter, Change Requests, and public comments, which will be linked from the SWG’s page.

Please feel free to forward this announcement to any other appropriate lists. The OGC is an open standards organization; we encourage your feedback.

== Purpose of the Standards Working Group

The Global Entity Reference System (GERS) was developed by the https://overturemaps.org/[Overture Maps Foundation] and launched in June 2025 as a way to provide unique, open, 
and interoperable identifiers for geospatial entities such as buildings, places, and road segments. This system aims to simplify data integration and sharing across different 
datasets and platforms, fostering collaboration and innovation in the geospatial industry.

Overture provides a complete and operational implementation of the GERS Model that includes data schemas, a registry schema, the GERS ID generation, processes, 
tools, and the physical foundation reference map maintained by the Overture Map Foundation. The proposed OGC GERS Standard will haves a more limited focus 
that includes the model as documented in the current Overture data and registry schema, and the generation of the GERS ID. This focus results in a standard that can be implemented 
by any organization that will be 100% consistent with the existing Overture foundation map but "owned" by the implementing organization. An example of this 
approach is the precisely implementation (See below).

== Business value proposition

Organizations can spend amount of time and resources on data preparation and integration rather than value-adding analysis. For organizations using geospatial data, 
the challenge is even more acute: Different data producers describe the same real-world entities in different ways, use different reference systems, and different 
ontologies. The combinations of these differences make it expensive and time-consuming to combine datasets from these different sources. 

Often, the cost of integrating data exceeds the cost of the initial data capture and any related licensing. This is the data conflation tax – a hidden cost 
that affects everyone working with data obtained from multiple sources.

GERS changes this equation by providing persistent, unique identifiers for every geospatial entity – from buildings and roads to places and addresses. 
With GERS, what once took weeks of complex geospatial conflation can now be accomplished in minutes with simple column joins.

=== Benefits of implementing GERS

The key benefits of implementing GERS as identified by the Overture Foundation community are:

- Simplified Data Integration: GERS IDs allow developers to easily link datasets by joining columns rather than relying on complex data conflation processes, saving time and resources. 
- Reduced Costs: By streamlining data integration, GERS helps reduce the "hidden tax" of data integration, making it more cost-effective to incorporate new data into mapping solutions. 
- Increased Interoperability: GERS promotes interoperability by providing a common language for identifying geospatial entities, enabling data sharing and collaboration between different organizations and platforms. 
- Enhanced Data Richness: With GERS, it becomes easier to enrich map data with information from various sources, leading to more comprehensive and informative mapping applications. 
- Innovation in Geospatial: GERS is expected to drive innovation in the geospatial industry by reducing barriers to data integration and enabling the development of new and more powerful mapping solutions. 

== Scope of work

////
This section describes the scope of work (SOW) for the work of the SWG. There are typically at least three (3) cases that justify the formation of a SWG: A group of members decide to develop a new OGC candidate Standard from scratch, there is a draft submission being discussed by OGC members, or there are outstanding Change Requests for an existing OGC Standard and a revision is required.

The following describes the characteristics of a SOW for each of these cases.

For a SWG focused on defining and documenting a new OGC candidate Standard from “scratch,” the SOW SHALL include a statement of the requirements and use cases for the candidate Standard being developed. The SOW SHALL also include a justification statement for developing a new candidate OGC Standard. The SOW SHALL also describe how the new candidate Standard is related to the existing OGC Standards baseline and the OGC Reference Model. The final deliverable of a “from scratch” focused SWG SHALL be a candidate Standard ready for submission using the OGC standards process.

For a SWG focused on processing a draft submission such as a specification developed outside the OGC and submitted into the OGC for consideration, the SOW would include evaluation of the submission in terms of the relationship to the existing OGC Standards baseline (see section below). The final deliverable of such a SWG SHALL be a candidate Standard for consideration by the membership for adoption.

For a SWG focused on revisions to an existing adopted Standard, the SOW should include a statement that the SWG will collect all outstanding Change Request Proposals (CRPs), evaluate each of the proposals, and make edits to the Standard based on CRPs and related decisions of the SWG membership. The SWG, at their discretion, may also ask the membership for any additional change requests that have not been previous submitted. Again, the final deliverable of a revision focused SWG SHALL be a revision of the candidate Standard for consideration by the membership for adoption.

In all cases, the SWG Charter shall provide a basic timeline plan for their activities.
////

=== Statement of relationship of planned work to the current OGC Standards baseline

The GERS model and framework is based on the following international standards from the IETF, ISO, and the OGC including:

- The GERS ID is generated following the rules as defined in IETF https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122[RFC 4122] A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace.
- The GERS geometry model is consistent with https://www.iso.org/standard/26012.html[ISO 19107] as instantiated by the recommended use of GeoJSON as the encoding format for geometry in the GERS reference map data store.
- https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema] is used for defining all GERS schema including the ID registry and the structure of the foundation maps in the GERS reference map data store.
- https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet[GeoParquet] is the recommended distribution format for geospatial content contained in the reference map data store.

NOTE: A GERS referance map data store is a set of validated datasets that connect GERS IDs to real-world entities. The Overture GERS implementation provides a reference map with monthly open map data updaetes. These data updates are carefully validated, consistently structured collections that describe billions of real-world entities. Each entity in these datasets carries a unique GERS ID. These IDs represent actual physical entities in the world.

NOTE: Overture Maps Foundation provides global data across six data themes (addresses, base, buildings, divisions, places, and transportation), using well-partitioned GeoParquet as their primary distribution format across multiple clouds. This referebce map consists of billions of features across hundreds of gigabytes. 

=== Relationship to OGC Points of Interest (PoI) Conceptual Model Standard

The OGC docs.ogc.org/is/21-049/21-049.html[Points of Interest] (POI) Conceptual Model is an open data model for representing information about POI. 
A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates and an identifier. The model specifically states that "An encoding of the AbstractFeature class SHALL 
include zero or one identifier attributes" (Requirement 6) and that if an identifier is specified that the identifier of the feature is unique and valid globally.

NOTE: From PoI Standard - Abstract Feature class in POI model: identifer «property»	ScopedName [0..*]	Specifies the unique identifier of the feature that is valid globally.

Further, the geometry model specified in the GERS Model is consistent with the PoI geometry model (/req/core/geometry):

-The POI Conceptual Model spatial geometry properties SHALL be compliant with the Geometry Model defined in ISO 19107
- The spatial geometry properties of all POI instances SHALL be defined using one or more of the following classes: GM_Point, GM_LineString, GM_Polygon

=== Relationship to existing OGC standards baseline and standards in development in the OGC

The proposed GERS Community Standard does not conflict with or overlap functionalty defined in the current OGC Standards baseline or new standards being developed.
The GERS Model and implementations build on the existing OGC/ISO Standards baseline. Further, implementations of various OGC API Standards could be used to access
a GERS reference map data store.


=== What is out of scope?

The SWG will not extend the GERS framework beyond the capabilities and functions defined in the initial submission of GERS by the Overture Maps Foundation to the OGC.
Further, the SWG will not consider or standardize the current content in the Overture Maps datastore, the Overture processing tools, or any other implementation specific technology.

=== Specific existing work used as starting point

The GERS SWG will use the GERS framework, model, and schema as defined, in general, https://overturemaps.org/blog/2025/understanding-overtures-global-entity-reference-system/[here].

=== Is this a persistent SWG

[x] YES

[ ] NO

=== When can the SWG be inactivated

When the OGC GERS candidate standards is approved by the TC and the PC as an adopted OGC Standard.

== Description of deliverables

An OGC Global Entity Reference System Implementation Standard including relevant JSON schema. 

NOTE: User support materials are already available on the Overture Maps web site.

=== Initial deliverables

The initial deliverable will be a candidate OGC Global Entity Reference System Implementation Standard. 

=== Additional SWG tasks

Not applicable

== IPR Policy for this SWG

[x] RAND-Royalty Free

== Anticipated audience / participants

The target audience for a GERS Standard are the developers, companies, and organizations that build or use geospatial data and applications that require geospatial content from 
multiple datastores to be "joined" (fused). Particpants in the SWG activity would be any member that has digital twin, modelling, simulation, analytics, or AI training application requirements.


== Domain Working Group endorsement

////
The SWG will list all Domain Working Groups (DWGs) in which the SWG formation was discussed and/or chartered. If a DWG has specifically endorsed the formation of the SWG, then a statement of endorsement should be included.
////

== Other informative information about the work of this SWG

=== Collaboration

Overture Maps Foundation is a https://jointdevelopment.org/[Joint Development Foundation Project], an affiliate of the Linux Foundation.

=== Details of first meeting

The first ad-hoc meeting of the SWG will be held at the Boulder Meetings, October 2025. Once the charter is approved, participation information will be provided to the 
SWG's e-mail list and on the Agora calendar in advance of the meeting. During the first meeting, the SWG Chair and co-chair will be nominated and voted on. The other 
primary work item will be defining a timeline and work agenda.

=== Projected on-going meeting schedule

The work of the SWG will be carried out primarily by email and conference calls, possibly every two weeks, with face-to-face meetings perhaps at each of the OGC TC meetings. All content for the GERS standard will be maintained 
on an https://github.com/opengeospatial/Overture-Maps-GERS/tree/main[OGC Git repository].
