=== The GERS Model - High Level

==== GERS Registry

A GERS registry is a comprehensive database documenting every GERS ID created in a given GERS implementation.

Think of the GERS Registry as the authoritative phonebook for GERS IDs. It maintains:

* Complete lifecycle information for every ID
* Current location data for active entities
* Historical records for deprecated IDs
* Quick lookup capabilities for ID verification

Why it matters:

* Validation: Instantly verify if a UUID is a legitimate GERS ID
* History: Access the complete lifecycle of any GERS ID
* Efficiency: Quickly “catch up” if you haven’t updated for several releases
* Location services: Find where entities exist both geographically and within file structures
